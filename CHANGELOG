CHANGELOG

1.1.0 - Unreleased
------------------
* Added enabled and ensured service parameters
* Updating MySQL baseurl to work with curl
* No longer use sudo for service management -- this changes ownership of the daemon.log file and  will break for existing installs until they change ownership of the daemon.log from root to the new configured user

1.0.0 - 2014-01-29
------------------
* Initial release
